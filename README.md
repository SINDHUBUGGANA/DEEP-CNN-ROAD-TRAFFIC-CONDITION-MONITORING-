# DEEP-CNN-ROAD-TRAFFIC-CONDITION-MONITORING-
•	Built a road traffic condition model that classifies the situation into 4 classes: dense, sparse, road, and fire accidents.
•	Employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with multiple layers, totaling over 10 layers, to enhance the model's capacity dataset (Traffic net) for feature extraction and classification and improve its real-time accuracy.
•	Achieved a classification accuracy exceeding 85% on a held-out validation dataset, validating the model's efficacy in accurately classifying road traffic conditions in real-time scenarios.
